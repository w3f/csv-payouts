# CSV Payouts

## About

This script reads a list of recipients and the corresonding amounts to be
sent and executes each entry as a transaction on substrate based networks.

## Config

See [config/](./config/) for some examples.

### Main

```yaml
endpoint: wss://rpc.polkadot.io
actionFilePath: config/sample.actions.csv
keystore:
  walletFilePath: config/sample.key.json
  password: "p4ssw0rd"
```

### Action / CSV File

The action file contains a list of `<RECIPIENT>,<AMOUNT>` pairs that dictate
what transactions should be executed. For example;

```csv
1YgA2g4yVkKcDVktHrgEMT7n6YrU3tebH9Tu3hfpaiMCJJS,4
1PGsXH1HqkBMsQGcyHJscE9VxUnS9XSBHKFmkB8r4Vc7YFW,3.5
16VQH2rDYVGitsifyoNhwQyDQ5xFbR44i6vaQEayEqZ3nnn5,10
```

This script handles the conversion to the chains base units, e.g. if you specify
`4` on Polkadot (implying 4 DOTs to be sent) that the script will convert it
automatically to `4000000000` units.

### Wallet File

The account that should be used to execute the transaction. It expects a json
file exported from polkadot.js.org which is decrypted with the associated
`password`.

## Execution

NOTE: The execution of this script should **not** be interrupted (for
[caching](#caching) purposes). Instead, let it complete fully.

```console
$ yarn
$ yarn start -c config.yaml
```

Here's an example on the Westend network:

```

### Caching

Execution creates a local `.action_cache.json` file which keeps track of which
transactions have already been executed. Restarting the process will skip the
already completed transactions and continue with the remaining entries of the
CSV list until all have been successfully executed.
